# MBS - DEC MASSBUS Server

This repository contains the source code for MBS -- the MASSBUS Server Daemon.

The MASSBUS Server daemon (MBS) is the PC software which communicates with the Universal Peripheral Emulator FPGA board.  The UPE/FPGA then connects to a Digital Equipment Corporation MASSBUS controller and together the two are able to emulate MASSBUS drives.  Presently only a limited number of disk devices may be emulated; however it is the intention to eventually support emulation of many different disk and tape drives.

See the UPELIB and MDE2 repositories for the other components involved with this project.
